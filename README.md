Local Library app using Node Express

To launch project: 
$ DEBUG=express-localLibrary-tutorial:* npm start


Next up: Installing nodemon for a "watch" style development environment. 
npm install --save-dev demon
To install globally, then run: 
npm install -g nodemon

We've installed nodemon and written a script. Now to start (and watch) the server we only need to run: 
npm run devstart
